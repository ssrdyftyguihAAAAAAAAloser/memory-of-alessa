### setup

0. `python3`, `wget`, and essential build packages are prerequisites.

1. Insert the disc of Silent Hill 3 v1.02 (NTSC-U) for the PlayStation 2 into
   your computer. It has serial number `SLUS_206.22` and its ISO's SHA1 is
   `0f7b0d5d75fe34ddf72e26aae1b4f5e7891282b0`.

2. Copy the `SLUS_206.22` file as well as `B0.MFA` into the folder at
   `rom/SLUS_206.22` in this repository.

Then proceed below depending on your operating system.

#### linux (x86-64) & macOS (aarch64)

On first setup, run the following commands in the root directory of this
repository. They will set up a virtual environment and install the required
Python packages.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run `make`. This will download the toolchain, extract files, and build
Silent Hill 3.

```sh
make
```

#### windows

Untested, but WSL or similar is required.
